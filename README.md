# Setup Shop
This repository contains a database-driven website based on ASP.NET MVC Core with Entity Framework that I created. 
The website has a CRUD interface and contains login functionality and presents data from a SQLite database to users.

The website itself is a web store concept (as in all the functionality is there except payment) that allows users to purchase Setups which contain files that
can then be downloaded by the user and are linked to their Identity account.
